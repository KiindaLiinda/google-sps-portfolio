      <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a 2nd year, Computer Science and Engineering major at 
          the University of California Merced. I am from
          Los Angeles, California, but my parents are from Mexico. I first 
          learned to code through robotics at the age of 12 and my journey 
          went from there. I then taught myself basic web development, went 
          on to learn C++, Python, and Java, and have built an interest in 
          artificial intelligence and machine learning. On the side, I create 
          gaming content on Twitch and YouTube.</p>
      <h1 class="title">Programs and Projects</h1>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Built by Girls WAVE</h2> 
        <p>Built by Girls WAVE is a mentorship program for female and non-binary
            students to learn about STEM careers. I have been through 4 rounds and
            learned about various pathways to tech, things my mentors wish they
            would've known before, and even got a tour of one of my mentor's offices
            (Netflix HQ in Hollywood, CA)!</p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">She Leads (now Gen She) Entrepreneurship Makeathon</h2>
        <p>The Entrepreneurship Makeathon is an event for high school female/non binary 
            students to learn about the steps it takes to start a business. We also got 
            to pitch our own ideas to win a mentorship opportunity with a business 
            consulting company. I was one of the 3 grand prize winners for this event.</p>      
      <h2 class="subtitle">Google CSSI</h2>
        <p>Summer of 2019, I spent 3 weeks at the Google LAX campus with 2 of my high
            school classmates, and a ton of other recent high school graduates. We learned 
            HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python and Google's App Engine. It was an amazing experience. 
            The link to our final project can be found 
            <a href="https://github.com/lindajgarcia323/cssi-final-project" class="link">here</a>. </p>
      <h2 class="subtitle">Hack Merced V</h2>
        <p>Hack Merced was the second hackathon I've ever attended, and it took place at 
            my university. I spent 36 hours with 3 of my friends, where I put the skills I 
            learned at CSSI to the test and built a web application to help the homeless in 
            Merced. My team and I won the "Best Social Good Hack" category for this hackathon 
            and I will be participating in Hack Merced VI in March with one of my former teammates.
