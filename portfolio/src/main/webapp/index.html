      <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
      <p>I am a 2nd year, Computer Science and Engineering major at 
          the University of California Merced. I am from
          Los Angeles, California, but my parents are from Mexico. I first 
          learned to code through robotics at the age of 12 and my journey 
          went from there. I then taught myself basic web development, went 
          on to learn C++, Python, and Java, and have built an interest in 
          artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>
